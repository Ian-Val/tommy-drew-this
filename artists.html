          <p>Craig Medeiros is an artist who feels awkward talking about himself in the third person.
            A holder of a BFA in Illustration and a Graphic Design certificate, he was born in Fall River MA and now resides in Wethersfield CT.  His youth was spent learning rhymes about Lizzie Borden's murder weapon and filling his Algebra notebooks with cartoons instead of numbers.
            His work tends to focus on drips and splatters, long-nosed freaks and obnoxious color schemes inspired by a half-remembered haze of 80's and 90's pop culture. Except when it doesn't.
            He has won awards for graphic design and illustration and has shown his work in several publications and galleries around the United States under the alias Mister Tengu.
            And yes, he gets paint everywhere.
